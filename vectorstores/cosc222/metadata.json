    "Basic Computer Terminology\nA computer is a device that can be programmed to solve problems.\n\u2022 Question: Is a cell phone a computer? A) yes B) no\nSoftware is a program the computer follows to perform functions.\nMemory is a device which allows the computer to store data either\ntemporarily or permanently (data is preserved even when there is no\npower).\n\u2022 Many different technologies for storing data with varying performance.",
    "\u2022 Flash memory used in mobile devices (e.g. USB drives, phones) is permanent.\n\u2022 Question: Does a hard drive store data permanently? A) yes B) no\nDATA 301: Data Analytics (4)\n\"The Cloud\"\n\"The Cloud\" is not part of your computer but rather a network of\ndistributed computers on the Internet that provides storage,\napplications, and services for your computer.\nThese systems and services simplify tasks that otherwise would be\ndone by programs on your computer.\nExamples:",
    "done by programs on your computer.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Dropbox is a cloud service that allows you to store your files on machines\ndistributed on the Internet. Automatically synchronizes any files in folder with all\nyour machines.\n\u2022 iCloud is an Apple service that stores and synchronizes your data, music, apps,\nand other content across Apple devices.\nDATA 301: Data Analytics (5)\nWhat is Data?\nData is information before it has been given any context, structure and\nmeaning.",

    "Data facts:\n\u2022 Over 90% of the data in world history was created over the last few years.\n\u2022 Estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes (2.5 EB) generated per day.\n\u2022 Global mobile data traffic is expected to reach 77.5 exabytes per month!\n\u2022 Google processes about 3.5 billion requests/day and stores about 20 EB of data.\n\u2022 Facebook collects/generates 4 PBs/day and stores 300+ PB of data.\n\u2022 There are approximately 44 zettabytes of data in the world in 2020.",

    "more complex. However, the principle is exactly the same. We use\nsequences of bits and interpret them based on the context to\nrepresent information.\nAs we learn more about representing information, always remember\nthat everything is stored as bits, it is by interpreting the context that\nwe have information.\nDATA 301: Data Analytics (23)\nMetadata\nMetadata is data that describes other data.\nExamples of metadata:\n\u2022 names of files\n\u2022 column names in a spreadsheet",

    "from the device.\nThe program using the file must know how to interpret those bytes\nbased on its information (e.g. metadata) on what is stored in the file.\nDATA 301: Data Analytics (25)\nFile Encoding\nA file encoding is how the bytes represent data in a file.\nA file encoding is determined from the file extension (e.g. .txt or .xlsx)\nwhich allows the operating system to know how to process the file.\n\u2022 The extension allows the OS to select the program to use. The program",

These files are readable by humans.\nThere are many different text file encodings:\n\u2022 CSV \u2013 comma-separate file \u2013 each line is a record, fields separated by commas\n\u2022 tab-separated file \u2013 each line is a record, fields separated by tabs\n\u2022 JSON file \u2013 data encoded in JSON format",

    "Processing a binary file requires the user to understand its encoding so\nthat the bytes can be read and interpreted properly.\nDATA 301: Data Analytics (30)\nUPC Barcodes\nUniversal Product Codes (UPC) encode manufacturer on left side and\nproduct on right side.

However, saving space often makes",
    "it harder to figure out what the data means (think of compression or\nabbreviations).
